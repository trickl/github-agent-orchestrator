"""Explicit workflow domain concepts.

This package introduces first-class types for:
- Trigger events (signals)
- Deterministic actions (procedural steps)
- Cognitive tasks (LLM-backed synthesis steps)
- A persisted workflow state machine

The intent is to make long-horizon execution restartable, inspectable, and
deterministic in its control flow.
